 - *Goal categorizing screen:*
   - Change from portrait to landscape view
   - Change from drop downs to radial buttons
   - Type should be multiple select
   - Need to add time on clock
 - *Ability to export/email .cvs file for data manipulation*
 - *Finish game/player/team cards as in shared folder*
 - *Be able to switch goalies during a period*
   - Asks for time on clock to calculate minutes played behind the scenes
