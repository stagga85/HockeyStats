##GITLAB - DEV BRANCH

All development goes on here.

Things to do.
- **Activities**
 - *Team (New/Edit)*
   - This is basically a form that is used to input all of the specific
     to each individual team that is entered in to the application. For now,
     teams will only be visible to the creating APP_USER. Possibly in the
     future there will be a list of teams that are added by developers that
     application users can select from.
 - *Player (New/Edit)*
   - Form for entering the information that is required to create a new
     player in the database.
 - *Game (New/Edit)*


## Ideas
- Use node.js for RESTful API
  - This seems like the best option for now.
- OAuth2 to authenticate
